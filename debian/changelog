    Heiko Schlittermann for finding this (closes: #396343).

 -- sean finney <seanius@debian.org>  Wed, 01 Nov 2006 19:14:29 +0100

    for the thorough description and clean patch. closes: #392010.

nsca (2.6-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release

  [sean finney]
  * new french debconf translations from Sylvain Archenault (closes: #362712).
  * upstream has incorporated our chroot support patch, so
    05_nsca_chroot.dpatch is no longer necessary.

  * initscript modifications to relfect that nsca now supports a pid_file
    directive and reloading of configuration via HUP natively.

nsca (2.5-2) unstable; urgency=low

  [sean finney]
  * add debconf support for whether nsca service should
    be installed at boot time.  if nagios/nagios2 is installed
    the default behaviour is to start/stop the daemon.  otherwise,
    the default is to not activate it.  this should make a single nsca
    package useful for both "central server" and "satellite"
    installations, as well as making it easier for admins to run
    it out of inetd configurations as well (closes: #281828, #353901).
  * nsca now supports chrooting when run in daemon mode (closes: #353272).  

  [marc haber]
  * remove install calls from debian/rules, use dh_install to ease
    backporting. Adapt lintian override file to nagios2 method.
  * Add possibility to locally build an nsca-client package which cannot
    be in Debian.

 -- sean finney <seanius@debian.org>  Fri, 31 Mar 2006 07:27:21 +0200

nsca (2.5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release

  [sean finney]

  * fix for upstream shuffling of some files' location in the tarball.
  * lintian fixes in manpage
  * migrate to svn while we're at it.

nsca (2.4-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Sean Finney:
    - errors and warnings now go to stderr (closes: #294097).
    - move away from this debmake stuff for building, because
      i don't understand it and it's getting to the point i have
      to work with it.
    - manpages by yours truly
    - nsca now uses the init script by default.  it can be disabled
      in favor of inetd support, but the default will now be init
      based.

 -- sean finney <seanius@debian.org>  Sat, 10 Dec 2005 21:17:36 +0100

nsca (2.4-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Sean Finney:
    - include a simple init script for those who would prefer to avoid
      using inetd (closes: #336712).  for the time being, inetd is still
      the default so no runlevel symlinks are installed, but this may
      change in the future.
    - include a patch to let nsca run without forking to the background;
      this is necessary for the above feature.
    - default to using /etc/send_nsca.cfg instead of ./send_nsca.cfg.
      thanks to Juraj Bednar for pointing this out (closes: #342017).

  * nsca is now part of the pkg-nagios alioth project.
  * Sean Finney
    - update Maintainer/Uploaders to reflect Maintainership.
    - update Depends and Suggests to reflect that nsca does not require
      nagios to be installed, which should keep the installation footprint
      much smaller (closes: #324821, #270796).
    - update Standards-Version to 3.6.2.

 -- sean finney <seanius@debian.org>  Sat, 29 Oct 2005 14:07:22 +0200
